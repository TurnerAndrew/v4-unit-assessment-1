    For this section of the assessment you will be putting together a cheat sheet for common git commands.  
    You'll provide the command as well as what it does. 
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitDefinition'.
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what Git is.
*/

const gitDefinition = 'Git is a version control system that allows you to back up your code online and allows teams to work from the same version of code without copying and pasting to ensure that everyone is working from the most up to date version.'

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitHubDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what GitHub is.
*/

const gitHubDefinition = "GitHub is an online repository for code.  If git repos are the currency, GitHub could be considered the bank that holds the currency."

//////////////////PROBLEMS 3 - 9////////////////////
/*
    For the next several problems you will be creating objects containing information about different git 
    commands.  Each object should contain 'description' and 'code' properties.  The 'description' property 
    will be a string with a description of what that git command does.  The 'code' property should be a 
    string of the actual command (what you type into your terminal).
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'init' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the init command.
*/

const init = {
    description: 'creates a git repository in the present working directory on your local machine',

/*
    Create an object called 'clone' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the clone command.
*/

const clone = {
    description: 'creates a copy of the referenced code in your pwd',
    code: 'git clone <location>'

//////////////////PROBLEM 5////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'status' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the status command.
*/

const status = {
    description: 'provides information about the status of your files - if they have been changed, added or committed',
    code: 'git status'

//////////////////PROBLEM 6////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'add' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the add command.
*/

const add = {
    description: 'moves files to staging area',
    code: 'git add <filename or *>'

//////////////////PROBLEM 7////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'commit' with 'description' and 'code' properties
    following the guidelines above to describe the commit command.
*/

const commit = {
    description: 'prepares changes to be pushed',
    code: 'git commit -m "commit message"'
}

//////////////////PROBLEM 8////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'addRemote' with 'description' and 'code' properties
    following the guidelines above to describe the command to add a remote location to your git repository.
*/

const addRemote = {
    description: 'The closest thing I could find for addRemote was git remote add which adds an online destination for your code to be pushed to',
    code: 'git remote add origin>'

//////////////////PROBLEM 9////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'push' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the push command.
*/

const push = {
    description: 'transfers or "pushes" your code to the remote repo',
    code: 'git push <url of remote repo>'
